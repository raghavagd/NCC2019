                target="_blank">Department of Electrical
                Communication Engineering</a> (ECE) at

                target="_blank">Indian Institute of
                Science</a> (IISc) to encourage interaction
                between the vibrant tech industry of
                Bangalore and the researchers at the
                IISc. The city of Bangalore, revered as
                the tech capital of India, has seen
                unprecedented growth in tech startups and
                tech development centers. The IISc,
                located at the heart of Bangalore, is one of
                the oldest technical institutes of India, with
		a long standing tradition of excellence
                in research and innovation. IIS@ECE provides
                a forum for an informal interaction between the
                researchers of IISc and the technology
                developers of Bangalore. Every month a
                distinguished speaker from the industry will
                visit the ECE department and present a
                technical problem that interests their
                company. This will be followed by a
                discussion with the audience, a student
                roundtable, and of course, coffee in the
                ECE hut. We invite everyone to come and
                share ideas or a cup of coffee with the tech
                leaders of Bangalore in the lush green ECE
                department!

		      <b>Where?</b> Golden Jubilee Hall, ECE Department<br />
		      <b>What?</b> In a tech start-up, once the vision has been conceived, system modeling and performance analysis of candidate algorithms and methods are carried out. However, simulations  go through constant changes at every stage of the design and development process. A change in the later stages of development is often expensive and time consuming. In this context, I will talk about few best practices for innovation which can help reduce  the product development cycle.
