            <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Generative model-based text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis has grown in popularity in the last a few years. Thanks to the recent progress of neural end-to-end approaches, it has reached the human-level quality in naturalness with flexibility to change its voice characteristics for synthesizing isolated sentences. Some of them have already been in production systems and served millions of queries.  This tutorial will follow the progress of this technology from its fundamental concept to the real implementation, including the conventional statistical parametric speech synthesis to the latest neural end-to-end models.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Abstract:</strong> 5G wireless networks are envisaged to support gigabit links to meet the ever-increasing demand for higher data rates. In this context, millimeter wave (mmWave) communication, which leverages the vast spectral opportunities in the mmWave band (30 – 300 GHz), has shown significant promise towards realizing the goals of next generation wireless systems. Further, due to the lower wavelength, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a natural technology of choice for such systems, which can significantly enhance their throughput.  However, practical realization of mmWave MIMO technology is fraught with challenges since it is vulnerable to significantly higher losses arising from its higher carrier frequencies and also due to the increased hardware complexity for signal processing required to support the high bandwidth communication. To overcome these barriers, hybrid RF-baseband processing has emerged as a popular choice due to its lower complexity and improved RF/ baseband load distribution. This tutorial will present a brief analytical introduction to transceiver design and signal processing for mmWave MIMO systems, coupled with practical insights.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods of today are based on learning from examples--a methodology commonly known as machine learning.  This tutorial provides an overview of modern methods of machine learning while introducing topics of current research interest—which include deep learning, probabilistic graphical models and reinforcement learning.</p> 
<p>There will be four parts to the tutorial: <ol><li>overview of machine learning</li> <li>deep learning</li> <li>probabilistic graphical models</li> <li>reinforcement learning</li></ol></p>
<p>We will begin with an overview of artificial intelligence and how simple machine learning techniques for classification and regression have largely replaced earlier knowledge-based methods.  We will describe supervised/unsupervised learning,  discriminative/generative models and specific algorithms such as logistic regression and SVMs.</p>
<p>The second part is about how deep learning differs from simple machine learning.  We will describe commonly used deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks.  We will also describe several deep learning research topics, such as learning representations where variables are disentangled and decision making is simplified.</p> 
<p>The third part will review probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). These are methods that allow reasoning with a diverse set of variables. They also allow explanations to accompany decisions. Methods of inference that overcome computational  intractability will also be discussed.</p>
<p>The final part will concern reinforcement learning. Here the learning data is from the environment when an autonomous agent performs actions. We will describe methods known as Q-learning and policy learning. In particular deep reinforcement learning will be described.</p>
