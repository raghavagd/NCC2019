                       <h4 style="text-align: justify;">DIRECTIONS to IISc from BANGALORE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT</h4>
                    <hr /> 
                    <p><strong>Easy directions:</strong> 
 			Ask a taxi to take you to the Tata Institute (which is what IISc is locally known as). This should suffice in most cases.</p>

 			<p>If you're unlucky and the taxi driver does not know where the Tata Institute is, then give him the following directions. 
 			From Mekhri Circle, take the road (called CV Raman Road) towards Yeshwanthpur. 
 			Keep straight at the first traffic signal (at Sadashiva Nagar Police Station). 
 			About 500m beyond this signal, you'll see the gates of IISc on the right-hand side.</p>

 			<p>If you're staying at the IISc Main Guest House, the Centenary Visitors' House, Jawahar guest house, or Hoysala house, 
 			please ask for directions at the IISc gate.</p>

 			<p>It is recommended that you take one of the metered taxis (Meru/KSTDC/EasyCabs) that are queued up outside on your left as you exit the airport terminal building. 
 			A metered taxi from the airport to IISc should cost you approximately Rs. 850 (plus possibly a 10% extra charge at night). 
 			Payment must be in cash, so make sure that you have sufficient cash (Indian Rupees) in hand when you leave the airport. 
 			Also, please be aware that you will be asked to pay a toll of Rs. 120 as you enter the highway leading to the city.</p>

 			<p>You can also choose to use one of the cab services such as (Ola/Taxi4Sure/Uber) by installing the respective app on your smartphone.</p>

 <p><strong>From airport by bus:</strong> 
 			 Shuttle bus service, operated by Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), runs from the airport to various areas in Bangalore city every 15 minutes. Details of the schedule can be found <a href="http://www.karnataka.com/watch/blr-airport/commute/" target="_blank">here</a>. Additional information on the airport can also be found at its official website: (<a href="http://www.bengaluruairport.com/" target="_blank">www.bengaluruairport.com</a>). Most buses stop at Mekhri circle, which is around 2km from IISc. From there, you can take an autorikshaw to "Tata Institute".</p>

                       <h4 style="text-align: justify;">DIRECTIONS to IISc from RAILWAY STATION/KEMPEGOWDA BUS STATION</h4>
                <hr />  
                <p>The Institute is known as "Tata Institute" to the locals and is just past Mekhri circle and on the way to Yeshwantpur.</p>
 		    <p><strong>Railway station/Kempegowda bus station:</strong> The city railway station is about 7 kms from IISc campus. You will have to get out of the station from platform number ONE and reach the prepaid taxi stand and hire a city taxi (costs about Rs 150). Majestic (or Kempegowda Bus station), which is 7kms from IISc, is the central Bus stand in Bangalore which is just opposite to the City Railway station. If you happen to reach Majestic, Bangalore by bus, go to platform number 22 from where almost all buses come to the Institute.</p>

                    <p>If you plan to take a bus from Majestic, you have to move past Malleswaram 18th cross bus stand  towards Yeshwantpur  in order to reach IISc (also popularly called Tata Institute). There is a bus stop on the highway near the yellow over bridge before Yeshwantpur circle. Also, there is a bus stop at Yeshwantpur tollgate, just off campus near R block. Most buses go to one of these places. The closest bus stop to the conference venue is the Malleshwaram 18th cross bus stop.</p>

                    <p><strong>Yeshwantpur railway station:</strong> The Yeshwantpur railway station is located at less than 2 km from the institute campus. You can take a 'pre-paid' auto from the counter located outside the exit gate of platform number 6. The landmark is CNR Rao Circle from where you can take the entry to IISc. Though the prepaid contract says IISc (Tata Institute as more popularly known) gate as the destination, the hostels and most of the academic departments are within 500 mts from the gate, and hence the auto can be requested to drop at your destination.</p>

                    <p>You can also choose to use one of the cab services such as (Ola/Taxi4Sure/Uber) by installing the respective app on your smartphone.</p>

                    <hr />      
                    <p><strong>Cab/Taxi:</strong> You can arrange taxis from IISc campus by contacting one of the following call taxi agencies.
 		    <ul>
 		       <li>Aishwarya Travels - +9180-23374826 / +9180-23647403 / +91-9341218070</li>
 		       <li>Aum Travels - +9180-23341011 / +91-9845402784</li>
 		       <li>Varsha Tours and Travels - +91-9035171263 / +91-9980873172</li>
 		    </ul></p>

 		    <p><strong>Autos:</strong>Malleswaram 18th cross and Yeshwantpur circle are the best places to catch an auto rickshaw. But if you're lucky, you'll find an auto at Prof. CNR Rao circle or at Circle Mariamma temple. Remember that autos cost 50% more early mornings (before 6am) and at night (after 10pm).</p>
