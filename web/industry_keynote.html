It is designed to address a wide range of use cases covering enhanced mobile broadband, mission critical services and massive IoT, and to support new spectrum bands in both sub 6 GHz and mmwave. The talk will briefly cover the 5G NR foundational technologies that makes this possible. It will then focus on the challenges in mmwave and mitigating techniques that make communication in mmWave possible on commercial handsets. </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Abstract:</strong> The National Digital Communication Policy 2018 states :
<ol>
 <li> At the current pace of digitisation and digitalisation, it is
    estimated that India’s digital economy has the potential to reach
    one trillion USD by 2025.</li>
 <li> With significant capabilities in both telecommunications and
    software, India, more than most countries, stands poised to benefit
    from harnessing new digital technologies and platforms to unlock
    productivity, thus catalysing economic growth and development</li>
</ol>

The 5G Vision for India has been defined as “5G technology has the
potential for ushering a major societal transformation in India by
enabling a rapid expansion of the role of information technology across
manufacturing, educational, healthcare, agricultural, financial and
social sectors. India must embrace this opportunity by deploying 5G
networks early, efficiently, and pervasively, as well as emerge as a
significant innovator and technology supplier at the global level.”

<p>The realization of these National Goals is dependent on the researchers
& innovators in the country actively participating is steering the
direction of emerging technologies to address the Unique challenges of
India.</p>

<p>This talk will try to highlight the need for driving research to address
India Specific requirements. This research can then be leveraged to
develop standards, influence global standards and hence the direction of
technology and product development.</p>

TSDSI provides the one-stop platform :
<ol>
 <li> To help researchers formulate research problems based on the
    Standardisation gaps needed for solving India’s Unique challenges</li>
 <li> To help researchers translate their research ideas and patents into
    Standards</li>
</ol>


<p>The talk will provide the flow to achieve the above at TSDSI
and invite the researchers at the conference to join hands in the
development and adoption of the next generation of technology for India.

             <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bio:</strong> Since February 2017, Ms. Pamela Kumar has been appointed as the Director General of TSDSI. An alumnus of PEC Chandigarh, Rutgers University and IIM Bangalore, Pamela brings with her an experience of 30+ years in the communications, computers and semiconductor industry. </p>

<p>TSDSI is involved in mobilising the Technical experts in the country to develop standards based on National Priorities & requirements and influencing Global Standards, particularly at ITU, 3GPP and other forums. Major contributions are being driven to incorporate India’s innovations to address Rural connectivity requirements for India and rest of the world. CCICI published a Framework & Roadmap for Cloud Computing Adoption in India and provided technical consultation on various aspects of the Cloud Computing Strategy for India. CCICI also formed the IoT for Smart Cities Task Force which published a series of reports related to Smart Cities Requirements Analysis, Smart Cities Reference Architecture, Smart Cities RFP Guidelines, Design & Planning of Smart Cities using IoT. </p>

<p>Prior to TSDSI, she has spent the first 10 years of her career at AT&T, Bell Labs in USA and at C-DOT in Bangalore. Later, she held leadership positions in Texas Instruments, IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, R&D labs in India. She also did a short stint with 2 startups, setting up the R&D centers of Network Programs and Alliance Semiconductors. She holds 3 Patents granted by USPTO and has 5 patent applications pending in the Networking Accelerators domain. She has been a Keynote/ invited speaker in 60+ Local and Global forums. </p>

<p>Pamela is also the Founding Chair and current President of Cloud Computing Innovation Council of India (CCICI).

            <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Abstract:</strong> To capitalize on the promise of mmWave for 5G, researchers
must develop new technologies, algorithms and communications protocols
as the fundamental properties of the mmWave channel are different from
current cellular channels and are relatively unexplored. Building mmWave
system prototypes demonstrate the viability and feasibility of a
technology or concept that simulations alone cannot.  mmWave prototypes
communicating in real-time and over the air in a variety of scenarios
will unlock the secrets of the mmWave channel and enable technology
adoption and proliferation. In this presentation we will explore a
software defined architecture that was designed with 5G in mind which
allows researchers to create and test over-the-air prototypes of 5G New
Radio (NR) communications links.
