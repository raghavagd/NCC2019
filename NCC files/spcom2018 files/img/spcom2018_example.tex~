This note provides instructions for the preparation of papers
for submission to SPCOM 2018, and the relevant style file that produced
this page.
\end{abstract}

\vspace{.5in}
{\bf IMPORTANT NOTE:} All submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and relevance through {\bf double-blind reviewing}, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers. As an author, you are required to preserve the anonymity of your submission, while at the same time allowing the reader to fully grasp the context of related past work, including your own. Common sense and careful writing will go a long way towards preserving anonymity. Papers that do not conform with our double-blind submission policies will be rejected without review.

\section{Introduction}
SPCOM 2018 will be held at the J.N.~Tata Auditorium in the 
Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, India, from Sunday, June~12 to
Wednesday, June~15, 2016.



\section{Submission and Review Process}
Papers will be reviewed on the basis of a manuscript of sufficient
detail to permit reasonable evaluation. The manuscript should {\bf
not exceed {\bf FIVE} double-column pages, with single line spacing, main
text font size no smaller than 10 points, and at least 3/4 inch
margins (about 18 mm)}. The deadline for submission is {\bf Monday, Jan 11, 2016}, with notification of decisions by {\bf Sunday, April 10, 2016}. The deadline for the final camera-ready paper is {\bf Saturday, April 30, 2016}. Final manuscript guidelines will be made available after the
notification of decisions.


%\section{Proceedings}
%All the accepted papers will be published in a conference
%proceeding. All the registrants at the conference will receive a
%copy of the proceedings.

\section{Preparation of the Paper}
Only electronic submissions in the form of a Postscript (PS) or Portable
Document Format (PDF) file will be accepted. Most authors will
prepare their papers with \LaTeX. The \LaTeX\ style file
(\verb#IEEEtran.cls#) and the \LaTeX\ source
(\verb#spcom2016_example.tex#) that produced this page may be
downloaded from the SPCOM 2018 web site
(http://ece.iisc.ernet.in/$\sim$spcom/2016). Do not change the style file
in any way. 
Authors using other means to prepare their manuscripts
should attempt to duplicate the style of this example as closely as
possible.

The style of references, 
e.g.,
\cite{Shannon1948},\cite{Kalman1960},\cite{Rao2008},\cite{Mhatre2009}, 
equations, figures, tables, etc.,
should be the same as for the \emph{IEEE Transactions on Information
Theory}. 
%The affiliation shown for authors should constitute a
%sufficient mailing address for persons who wish to write for more
%details about the paper.

\section{Electronic Submission}
The paper submission portal is EDAS:
\begin{center}
\texttt{https://edas.info/newPaper.php?c=21456}
\end{center}
For relevant announcements please check the SPCOM 2018 website
(http://ece.iisc.ernet.in/~spcom/2016).
