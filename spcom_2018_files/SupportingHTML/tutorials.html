        <p class="contentpane" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Abstract:</strong> i) Introduction: We begin by introducing sparse signals, that is,
signals having mostly zero values and a few non-zero values. We extend
explicitly sparse signals to approximately sparse signals (mostly
insignificant values and a few large values) and to implicitly sparse
signals (sparse in some basis). We provide real examples of such
signals. We compare CS with conventional sampling, differentiating
between local and global measurements. We illustrate with examples why
recovery from CS measurements is an ill-conditioned problem in general
with possibly many solutions, and how sparsity helps converge to a
unique solution. Then we formally introduce compressed sensing
measurement and recovery for different cases such as
explicitly/approximately/implicitly sparse signals. We use examples to
illustrate recovery using l0 minimization, and state and prove the
recovery theorem. We show the difficulty in l0 minimization, which
directly measures the sparsity of a signal. We then show how l1
minimization is a good compromise. We graphically illustrate how lp
minimization for p ≤ 1 is different from l2 minimization.
</p>
<p>
ii) Analysis: The foundation of CS lies in a series of beautiful
theoretical results. Contrary to popular belief, these results are not
difficult to follow. In this part of the lecture, we present a
step-by-step, simple-to-follow proof of the recovery theorem for l1
minimization. We distinguish between non-uniform and uniform recovery
result. We  begin by associating the tail probabilities of singular
values of the sub-matrix of the measurement matrix to RIP (restricted
isometry property) constant. We then find the required number of
measurements to make the RIP constant small enough. A small RIP
constant leads to null space property. To end, null space property
implies recovery. Several examples are used throughout the analysis
for lucidity.
</p>
<p>
iii) Measurement Matrices: CS provides many choices of measurement
matrices. We look at desirable properties of measurement matrices (RIP
and mutual coherence). We introduce examples of random measurement
matrices (Gaussian and Bernoulli), structured random matrices
(Toeplitz and circulant), structured deterministic matrices (partial
Fourier), and deterministic measurement matrices. We discuss combining
measurement matrices with basis for implicitly sparse signals.
</p>
<p>
iv) Reconstruction Algorithms: CS would not have been exciting to
engineers without efficient reconstruction algorithms. These
algorithms belong to one of 4 classes: combinatorial algorithms,
non-convex minimization algorithms, convex relaxation algorithms, and
greedy pursuit algorithms. We briefly mention many algorithms under
this class, and discuss in detail (including illustrative examples)
three important reconstruction algorithms: basis pursuit (BP) under
convex relaxation since it typically performs the best; orthogonal
matching pursuit (OMP) under greedy pursuit since it typically is
fast; and complex relaxation message passing (CAMP) since it is
attractive for very large scale applications.
</p>
<p>
v) Applications: CS has numerous applications in signal processing. We
consider some general processing tasks such as compression, denoising,
and recognition/classification, and show how CS finds application for
each of these areas. Illustrative results are also presented.</span></p>

		<p class="contentpane" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Abstract:</strong> Wireless communication using visible light wavelengths (400 to 700 nm)
		in indoor local area network (LAN) environments is emerging as a
		promising area of research and innovation. Visible light communication
	(VLC) is evolving as an appealing complementary technology to radio
	frequency (RF) communication technology. Maturing solid state lighting
	technology (using white LEDs) has contributed to this growing interest.
	A major attraction of VLC in indoor communication is its potential to
	simultaneously provide both energy-efficient lighting as well as
	high-speed short-range communication using high-luminance LEDs.
	In VLC, simple and inexpensive LEDs and photo diodes (PD) act as signal
	transmitters and receptors, respectively, replacing more complex and
	expensive transmit/receive RF hardware and antennas in RF communication
	systems (like WiFi). Other favorable aspects in VLC include availability
	of abundant visible light spectrum at no cost, no licensing issues,
	no radiation hazard, and inherent security in closed-room applications.
	In addition, the potential for simultaneously using multiple LEDs and
	PDs in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) array configurations has
	enthused MIMO wireless researchers (including the speaker) to take
	special interest in VLC.
<br />
	This tutorial will cover the following topics in VLC:

<ul>
	<li> An overview of VLC tracing its evolution in the past two decades
	  from a relatively low data-rate point-to-point wireless communication
	  system to a gigabit wireless networking technology, and interesting
	  application scenarios.</li>

	<li> PHY layer issues and techniques in VLC: Key differences between VLC
	  and RF communication (RFC) technologies; VLC channel characteristics
	  and channel models, modulation schemes for VLC; communication using
	  multiple LEDs and PDs (MIMO) and OFDM in VLC, precoding in VLC,
	  illumination (lighting) constrained VLC (i.e., simultaneous modulation
	  and dimming). </li>

	<li> VLC networking and standardization efforts: Adapting off-the-shelf LED
	  light fixtures into wireless access points; optical attocells.
</li>
</ul>

         received the Diploma in ECE (with highest honors) and the Ph.D. degree from the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) in Greece, in 2003 and 2009 respectively. After that, he worked for 3 years as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the School of Elec. Engineering of the University of Southern California (USC), as member of the Signal Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory. He is currently a Research Associate at the Robotic Perception and Interaction Unit of Athena RC in Greece. His research interests lie in the fields of speech analysis and multimodal signal processing and understanding, aiming at the interpretation and modeling of human behavior. He is the principal investigator of a Greek project funded by the Onassis Foundation on multimodal gesture and distant speech recognition, and he is also working on audiovisual speech synthesis and audiovisual saliency estimation in the frame of other EU and national research projects (Babyrobot, MOBOT).

	<p class="contentpane" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Abstract:</strong> Starting from the famous "Put that there!" demonstration by the Architecture Machine Group at MIT in the late 70s, the growing potential of multimodal gesture interfaces in natural human-machine communication setups has stimulated people's imagination and has motivated significant research effort in the areas of computer vision, speech recognition, multimodal sensing, fusion and human-computer interaction. In recent years particularly, the introduction and use of advanced sensing technologies, e.g., combined RGB-D-A (color, depth, skeleton and audio) sensors to capture human activity, has accelerated the integration of such interfaces in real-life applications as well. This tutorial will bring together all the necessary pieces to provide a comprehensive view of multimodal gesture recognition both in theoretical and application terms. More specifically:
a) Basic concepts of multimodal human communication and the importance of gestures (accompanied with speech or not) in language will be briefly discussed, 
b) an overview of state-of-the-art multimodal gesture recognition approaches will be given, focusing on temporal modeling and fusion, using, e.g., Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) or Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and, finally,
c) at least one multimodal gesture recognition setup will be described in detail to facilitate a better understanding of all practical considerations involved. 
A discussion of related application examples and challenges will conclude the tutorial.

</span></p>


<p class="contentpane" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Abstract:</strong> This is a three hour (half day) tutorial that examines a Bayesian framework to address algorithmic issues that arise in sparse signal recovery problems. There are numerous signal processing and communications applications where this problem naturally arises. Parsimonious signal representation using overcomplete dictionaries for compression, estimation of sparse communication channels with large delay spread as in underwater acoustics, low dimensional representation of MIMO channels, brain imaging techniques such as MEG and EEG, are a few examples.
The emergence of compressive sensing and the associated l1 recovery algorithms and theory have generated considerable excitement and interest in their application. This tutorial will examine more recent developments and a complementary set of tools based on a Bayesian framework to address the general problem of sparse signal recovery and the challenges associated with it. The Bayesian methods show considerable promise and have the flexibility necessary to deal with more general scenarios than hitherto possible. This generality and flexibility greatly facilitates their deployment in practice, even though they generally lead to non-convex optimization problems. The theory behind when and why these non-convex methods work is only now being developed. Signal processing and communications engineers are well versed in statistical methods and so have the background necessary to benefit from this exposure. This tutorial will provide a gentle, yet in-depth overview to this fascinating and nascent area within sparse signal recovery.</span></p>

<p class="contentpane" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Abstract:</strong> Satellite communications, backed up by wide coverage, is
considered as an essential player in satisfying the increasing data
traffic demands over the coming decades, e.g. 5G networks, machine to
machine communications (M2M) and Internet of things (IoT). To achieve
this, a migration from the traditional link budget based design to
more sophisticated user and service centric design is envisaged. This
has encouraged the satellite industry and academia to apply advanced
signal processing tools to satellite communications, in particular the
future generation of high throughput satellite systems. Amongst
others, linear and non-linear precoding, interference exploitation,
synchronization under challenging environments, advanced non-linear
receivers, distributed gateway processing, full-duplex satellite
networks, spectrum monitoring, and cognitive satellite communications
are topics of high importance for satellite entities.  The aim of the
tutorial is to introduce the emerging field of satellite
communications to the wider SPCOM community. The tutorial describes
the evolution of satellite systems and their offerings, brings out the
technical challenges and peculiarities of such systems, highlights the
potential in applying signal processing techniques for satellite
communications, provides an overview of the state-of-art and sketches
a technological roadmap.</span></p>

<p class="contentpane" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Abstract:</strong> How many ideas can we communicate by writing on a sheet of paper? How
well can we hear a concert? How many details can we distinguish in an
image? How much data can we get from our internet connection? These are
all questions related to the transport of information by waves. Our
sensing ability to capture the differences between distinct waveforms
dictates the limits of the amount of information that is delivered by a
propagating wave. The problem of quantifying this precisely requires a
mathematical description and a physical understanding of both the
propagation and the communication processes. This tutorial takes us on a
journey through the theory of functional approximation, electromagnetic
wave propagation, and information theory, to determine the ultimate
limits on degrees of freedom, entropy, and capacity, of radiated
signals. We compare Shannon's and Kolmogorov's approaches to information
theory, recall classic results of Landau, Pollack, and Slepian, draw
connections with the theory of sparse signals and compressed sensing,
and explore the universal limits of information in our world, viewed in
a quantum setting. The tutorial will be self-contained and presented in
a signal-theoretic friendly approach.</span></p>
